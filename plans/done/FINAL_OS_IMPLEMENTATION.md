# ✅ FINAL IMPLEMENTATION: OS Information in Tool Prompts

## Problem Solved ✨

**Before:** LLM needed to call `get_config` to learn the operating system, wasting a tool call and time.

**After:** Operating system information is embedded directly in every tool prompt, giving the LLM immediate context.

## What's Now in Every Tool Prompt

### At the Top of Tools List
```
🖥️ CURRENT OPERATING SYSTEM: macOS (darwin)
🐚 DEFAULT SHELL: zsh  
📁 PATH SEPARATOR: "/"
📄 EXAMPLE ABSOLUTE PATH: /path/to/file.txt
```

### At the Bottom of Tools List
```
🖥️ SYSTEM CONTEXT REMINDER:
- Operating System: macOS (darwin)
- Default Shell: zsh
- Use / for paths (example: /path/to/file.txt)
- Unix/Linux: Standard shell tools available (grep, awk, sed, etc.)
```

## Benefits Achieved 🎯

### For the LLM
- **Zero Tool Calls Needed**: Gets OS context immediately 
- **Always Aware**: Every tool interaction includes OS context
- **Smart Decisions**: Can choose appropriate commands from the start
- **No Guessing**: Knows exactly which platform and shell to target

### For Users  
- **Faster Responses**: LLM doesn't waste time figuring out the OS
- **Better Commands**: First suggestions are platform-appropriate
- **Fewer Errors**: Commands more likely to work on first try
- **Clear Context**: Tool responses show actual shell being used

## Platform-Specific Examples

### Windows Users See:
```
🖥️ CURRENT OPERATING SYSTEM: Windows (win32)
🐚 DEFAULT SHELL: powershell.exe
📁 PATH SEPARATOR: "\"
📄 EXAMPLE ABSOLUTE PATH: C:\path\to\file.txt
...
- Windows: Use "cmd" or "powershell.exe" if commands fail
```

### Linux Users See:
```
🖥️ CURRENT OPERATING SYSTEM: Linux (linux)  
🐚 DEFAULT SHELL: bash
📁 PATH SEPARATOR: "/"
📄 EXAMPLE ABSOLUTE PATH: /path/to/file.txt
...
- Unix/Linux: Standard shell tools available (grep, awk, sed, etc.)
```

### macOS Users See:
```
🖥️ CURRENT OPERATING SYSTEM: macOS (darwin)
🐚 DEFAULT SHELL: zsh
📁 PATH SEPARATOR: "/"  
📄 EXAMPLE ABSOLUTE PATH: /path/to/file.txt
...
- Unix/Linux: Standard shell tools available (grep, awk, sed, etc.)
```

## Technical Implementation ⚙️

### Changes Made
1. **server.ts**: Added OS info to tool prompt headers and footers
2. **Dynamic Content**: Uses template literals with SYSTEM_INFO object
3. **Conditional Logic**: Shows platform-specific guidance only when relevant
4. **Zero Overhead**: System detection happens once at startup

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes to tool behavior  
- ✅ Enhanced `get_config` still includes system info for advanced use cases
- ✅ Process responses still show shell information

## Testing Results ✅

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ OS detection working correctly (tested on macOS)
- ✅ Tool prompts include dynamic OS information
- ✅ Platform-specific guidance appears correctly
- ✅ No performance impact (detection at startup only)

## Mission Accomplished 🚀

The LLM now has **immediate access** to:
- Operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Default shell (PowerShell, zsh, bash)  
- Path format (\ vs /)
- Platform-specific guidance
- Example paths in correct format

**Result**: The LLM can provide perfect, platform-appropriate responses from the very first interaction without any tool calls to discover the operating system!
